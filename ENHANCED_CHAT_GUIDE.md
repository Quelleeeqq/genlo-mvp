# Enhanced Chat System Guide

## Overview

I've completely overhauled your AI chat system to provide much better responses like Claude and ChatGPT. The system now supports both Anthropic API and Google Vertex AI, giving you flexibility in choosing your AI provider.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced System Prompt**
The AI now uses a much more engaging and creative personality that generates responses similar to Claude and ChatGPT:

- **Creative Problem Solving**: Deep thinking about user needs
- **Engaging Communication**: Conversational, warm, and interesting responses
- **Comprehensive Help**: Goes above and beyond with examples and actionable steps
- **Practical Wisdom**: Combines creativity with practical advice
- **Personal Touch**: Adapts tone to user needs

### 2. **Better Model Configuration**
- **Model**: Upgraded to `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` (latest Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- **Temperature**: Increased to 0.7 for more creative responses
- **Max Tokens**: Increased to 4000 for longer, more detailed responses

### 3. **Dual Provider Support**
- **Anthropic API**: Direct integration with Claude models
- **Google Vertex AI**: Alternative provider using Google Cloud

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Anthropic API (Recommended)

1. **Get API Key**: Visit [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. **Add to Environment**: Add to your `.env.local`:
   ```env
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
   ```

### Option 2: Google Vertex AI

1. **Setup Google Cloud Project**:
   - Create a project in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Enable the Vertex AI API
   - Create a service account and download the JSON key

2. **Add to Environment**: Add to your `.env.local`:
   ```env
   GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION=us-east5
   ```

3. **Authentication**: The system uses Google's default authentication flow

## Testing the Improvements

### Test Page 1: Basic Chat
Visit `http://localhost:3003/test-chat` to test the basic improvements.

### Test Page 2: Enhanced Chat with Provider Selection
Visit `http://localhost:3003/test-chat-enhanced` to test both providers.

## Example Response Comparison

### Before (Generic Response):
```
Scene 1: [Show someone sitting hunched over a desk, looking uncomfortable. Suddenly, they use the backcracker device and let out a sigh of relief as their back cracks and they sit up straighter.]

Voiceover: Relieve back tension and discomfort with the Backcracker - the simple, portable solution for on-the-go back pain relief.

Scene 2: [Depict someone doing physical activity like gardening or household chores. They start to look pained, then use the backcracker and smile as the tension melts away.]

Voiceover: Don't let back pain slow you down. The Backcracker helps you stay active and comfortable, no matter what your day has in store.
```

### After (Enhanced Response):
```
Here are two sentence options for your back cracker TikTok video:

**Option 1 (Problem/Solution):**
"Tired of expensive chiropractor visits that drain your wallet? This amazing back cracker gives you instant relief at home for just $29!"

**Option 2 (Dramatic/Benefit):**
"One click and years of back pain just melted away - this portable back cracker is changing lives and it's only $29!"

**Bonus Option 3 (Social Proof):**
"Over 50,000 people can't be wrong - this back cracker is the #1 solution for instant back pain relief at home!"

These work well for TikTok because they're:
- Short and punchy
- Create urgency/curiosity
- Include a clear benefit
- Mention the price point
- Use emotional triggers (pain relief, saving money)

Which style matches your brand voice best? I can adjust the tone or create variations if needed.

## API Usage

### Basic Chat (Anthropic API)
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/ai-chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ 
    prompt: 'Your prompt here'
  }),
});
```

### Enhanced Chat (Choose Provider)
```javascript
// Anthropic API
const response = await fetch('/api/ai-chat-enhanced', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ 
    prompt: 'Your prompt here',
    provider: 'anthropic'
  }),
});

// Google Vertex AI
const response = await fetch('/api/ai-chat-enhanced', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ 
    prompt: 'Your prompt here',
    provider: 'vertex-ai',
    vertexConfig: {
      projectId: 'your-project-id',
      region: 'us-east5'
    }
  }),
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Model not found" error**
- The system now uses the correct model name: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`
- Make sure your API key has access to Claude 3.5 models

**"API key not configured" error**
- Check your `.env.local` file
- Restart your development server
- Verify API keys are correct

**Vertex AI authentication error**

### Getting Help
1. Test with the basic chat first: `/test-chat`
2. Try the enhanced chat with provider selection: `/test-chat-enhanced`
3. Check browser console for detailed error messages
4. Verify your environment variables are set correctly

## Cost Considerations

### Anthropic API
- Pay-per-use pricing
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet is more expensive than Haiku but provides much better quality
- Consider using Claude 3.5 Haiku for cost-sensitive applications

### Google Vertex AI
- Pay-per-use pricing
- Often more cost-effective for high-volume usage
- Requires Google Cloud project setup

## Next Steps

1. **Test the improvements**: Visit `/test-chat` and `/test-chat-enhanced`
2. **Choose your provider**: Decide between Anthropic API and Google Vertex AI
3. **Update your environment**: Add the appropriate API keys
4. **Integrate into your app**: Use the enhanced chat service in your components

The enhanced chat system should now provide responses that are much more engaging, creative, and helpful - just like the high-quality responses you get from Claude and ChatGPT!
