**GPT Image 1 Response:**
- Automatically selects appropriate gemstones (amethyst, rose quartz, jade, etc.)
- Creates realistic glass cabinet with proper lighting
- Arranges stones in an aesthetically pleasing way
- Uses real-world knowledge of gemstone properties

### Example 2: Comprehensive Image Analysis
**Image:** Product packaging with text and graphics
**Prompt:** "Analyze this product packaging and extract key information"

**Vision Response:**
- Extracts all text content
- Identifies product name, ingredients, nutritional info
- Recognizes brand elements and design features
- Provides structured analysis of packaging elements

### Example 3: Technical Document Analysis
**Image:** Technical diagram or chart
**Prompt:** "Explain what this diagram shows"

**Vision Response:**
- Identifies chart type and components
- Extracts data points and labels
- Explains relationships between elements
- Provides context for technical information

## Integration Points

### 1. **Chat Interface**
The chat system now supports:
- Automatic image generation requests
- Image analysis when files are uploaded
- Seamless integration with conversation flow

### 2. **Image Generator Component**
Updated to include:
- GPT Image 1 as the default option
- Enhanced model descriptions
- Better user guidance

### 3. **Test Pages**
Created dedicated test pages:
- `/test-gpt-image` - Test GPT Image 1 capabilities
- `/test-deep-research` - Test deep research features

## Cost Considerations

### 1. **Image Generation**
- GPT Image 1: Uses Responses API pricing
- Token-based billing for generation requests
- Competitive with other high-quality models

### 2. **Vision Analysis**
- **Low Detail**: 85 tokens (base cost)
- **High Detail**: Variable based on image size
- **Auto**: Model-optimized cost

### 3. **Optimization Tips**
- Use low detail for simple queries
- Batch similar analysis requests
- Cache results when possible
- Monitor usage with API headers

## Technical Implementation

### 1. **Model Architecture**
```typescript
// GPT Image 1 Generation
const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/responses', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${openaiApiKey}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'gpt-4.1-mini',
    input: prompt,
    tools: [{ type: 'image_generation' }],
    max_output_tokens: 1000
  }),
});
```

### 2. **Vision Analysis**
```typescript
// Image Analysis with Detail Control
const input = [{
  role: 'user',
  content: [
    { type: 'input_text', text: prompt },
    {
      type: 'input_image',
      image_url: `data:image/jpeg;base64,${imageBase64}`,
      detail: 'high' // or 'low', 'auto'
    },
  ],
}];
```

### 3. **File Upload Handling**
```typescript
// Convert file to base64 for analysis
const imageBuffer = await image.arrayBuffer();
const imageBase64 = Buffer.from(imageBuffer).toString('base64');
```
